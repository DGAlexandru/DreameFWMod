# DreameFWMod
Scripts to automate the modding of Dreame Vacuum Robots's FirmWare
This is an alternative way of having a rooted robot which is as close as it can be to the original FW, as opposed to DustBuilder's version which removes for the example the option to have remote video access / live camera from your robot.
Having it modded like this allows you to switch between OnLine (Cloud, original App) and OffLine (NoCloud or Valetudo) at any time, it requires only a command and a robot reboot.
